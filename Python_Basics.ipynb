        "  - Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and more, due to its clear syntax and extensive libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "  9 Factors of Python Popularity -\n",
        "\n",
        " ->Python is easy to learn\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the largest hurdles for those who are interested in getting into coding is that programming languages really are their own languages; they have their own rules, syntax, grammatical structures, etc., and they often necessitate learning a completely new vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 2. Python has an active, supportive community\n",
        "\n",
        "No programmer is an island; they depend on essential documentation and support so that when they encounter unexpected issues or new problems to solve, they have somewhere to go to find answers. Python has been around for over three decades, more than enough time for a dedicated user community to grow up around it. The Python community includes developers of all skill levels and provides easy access to documentation, guides, tutorials, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 3. Python is flexible\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is often described as a general-purpose programming language. This means that unlike domain-specific languages which are designed only for certain application types, Python may be used to develop nearly any kind of application in any industry or field.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 4. Python offers versatile web-development solutions\n",
        "Although Python is an effective choice for many kinds of development projects, its usefulness in web development is worth specific recognition. Using available open-source libraries, Python developers can get their web applications up and running quickly and easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 5. Python is well suited to data science and analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of the factors that make python an attractive choice for beginners also set it apart as a reliable option for data-science and data-analysis. Python’s ease of use, support, and flexibility have made it an essential tool for those who work with machine learning, cloud computing, and big data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 6. Python is efficient, fast, and reliable\n",
        "\n",
        "Occasionally, a developer that specializes in a different programming language might ask “Why is Python slow?” And yes, compared to some other languages, such as Java, C#, Go, JavaScript, or C++, Python often has a slightly slower execution speed. However, in today’s world, development time is much more important than computer run time. And in terms of time-to-market, Python simply cannot be beaten.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 7. Python is widely used with IoT Technology\n",
        "\n",
        "As wireless access becomes ever-more ubiquitous, the internet of things (IoT) continues to grow. These small, internet-connected devices often allow users to make small adjustments to their code, customizing their performance to fit specific needs. Many of these devices support either Python or Micropython (a scaled down version of the programming language designed for simpler devices).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 8. Python empowers custom automation\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming complex technologies generally requires writing a significant amount of code. Unfortunately, even small, simple tasks can end up co-opting large amounts of available developer time. Python incorporates tools and modules to help automate these repetitive, time-consuming tasks, so that developers can focus their energies on other important issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> 9. Python is the academic language\n",
        "\n",
        "Thanks to its growing dependability in the areas of data science, Python has become the go-to computing language in schools, colleges, and other places of learning. Simply put, those who pursue a formal education in computer science are extremely likely to be introduced to Python during the course of their learning and are even more likely to continue using Python throughout their career.\n",

        "  - In Python, an interpreter is a program that executes Python code directly, line by line, without needing to compile the entire program into machine code first. It reads, analyzes, and executes the code, providing immediate feedback. This makes Python an interpreted language, contrasting with compiled languages where the entire code is translated before execution.\n",

Lists are mutable, meaning that you can always change a list’s elements. Only immutable elements can be used as dictionary keys, and hence only tuples and not lists can be used as keys.\n",
